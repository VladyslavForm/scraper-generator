# Generated Scrapers

This directory contains automatically generated Python scraper functions.

Each scraper is a standalone Python file that can extract articles from a specific website without requiring LLM calls during execution.

The scrapers are generated by analyzing website HTML structure and detecting optimal CSS selectors for extracting article data.
