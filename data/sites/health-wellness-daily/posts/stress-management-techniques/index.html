                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Chronic stress undermines health, performance, and quality of life. While eliminating all stress is impossible, effective management strategies can dramatically reduce its negative impact. These evidence-based techniques offer practical tools for building resilience.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding the Stress Response</h2>
                    <p>Stress triggers physiological changes designed for short-term survival: elevated cortisol, increased heart rate, and heightened alertness. When activated chronically, these responses damage health, contributing to cardiovascular disease, weakened immunity, and mental health challenges.</p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                        <p>Research shows that perception of stress matters as much as stressors themselves. Developing adaptive coping strategies transforms stress from destructive to manageable.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Breathing Techniques</h2>
                    <p>Controlled breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, countering stress responses. Try box breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat for 5 minutes to reduce acute stress and promote calm.</p>

                    <h2>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h2>
                    <p>This technique involves systematically tensing and relaxing muscle groups throughout the body. Studies show it reduces physical tension and anxiety. Practice by tensing each muscle group for 5 seconds, then releasing while noticing the sensation of relaxation.</p>

                    <h2>Cognitive Reframing</h2>
                    <p>Challenge stress-inducing thoughts by examining evidence and considering alternative perspectives. Instead of catastrophizing, ask: What's the evidence? What would I tell a friend? What's a more balanced view? This cognitive shift reduces emotional reactivity.</p>

                    <h2>Time Management and Boundaries</h2>
                    <p>Many stressors stem from poor time management and weak boundaries. Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix: urgent/important, important/not urgent, urgent/not important, neither. Learn to say no to protect time for recovery and meaningful activities.</p>

                    <h2>Social Connection</h2>
                    <p>Strong social support buffers stress effects. Prioritize relationships that provide emotional support. Share challenges with trusted friends or family. Consider joining support groups or seeking professional help when needed.</p>

                    <h2>Lifestyle Foundation</h2>
                    <p>Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and balanced nutrition form the foundation of stress resilience. These factors directly influence stress hormone regulation and emotional regulation capacity.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Effective stress management combines multiple strategies tailored to individual needs. Experiment with various techniques, noting which provide greatest relief. Consistency matters more than perfection—small daily practices yield significant long-term benefits.</p>
