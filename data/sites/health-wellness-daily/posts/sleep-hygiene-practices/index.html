                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Quality sleep is foundational to physical health, cognitive function, and emotional wellbeing. Yet many people struggle with insufficient or poor-quality sleep. Implementing evidence-based sleep hygiene practices can dramatically improve both sleep quality and overall health.</p>

                    <h2>Why Sleep Matters</h2>
                    <p>During sleep, the body repairs tissues, consolidates memories, and regulates hormones. Chronic sleep deprivation increases risk for obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders. Adults need 7-9 hours nightly for optimal function.</p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Research Insight</h4>
                        <p>Studies show that even partial sleep restriction for several nights significantly impairs cognitive performance, emotional regulation, and metabolic health.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Consistency Is Key</h2>
                    <p>Maintain consistent sleep and wake times, even on weekends. This regularity strengthens circadian rhythms, making it easier to fall asleep and wake naturally. Irregular schedules disrupt these biological patterns, reducing sleep quality.</p>

                    <h2>Optimize Your Sleep Environment</h2>
                    <p>Create a cool (60-67°F), dark, and quiet bedroom. Use blackout curtains or eye masks to block light. Consider white noise machines to mask disruptive sounds. Invest in comfortable bedding and a supportive mattress.</p>

                    <h2>Light Exposure Management</h2>
                    <p>Expose yourself to bright light early in the day to support circadian rhythms. Dim lights 2-3 hours before bed. Avoid screens or use blue-light blocking glasses in the evening, as blue light suppresses melatonin production.</p>

                    <h2>Pre-Sleep Routine</h2>
                    <p>Establish a relaxing wind-down routine 30-60 minutes before bed. This might include reading, gentle stretching, meditation, or a warm bath. Avoid stimulating activities, difficult conversations, or work-related tasks.</p>

                    <h2>Lifestyle Factors</h2>
                    <p>Limit caffeine after 2 PM, as it can remain in your system for 6+ hours. Avoid alcohol close to bedtime—while it may help you fall asleep, it disrupts sleep architecture and reduces sleep quality. Regular exercise improves sleep, but avoid vigorous activity within 3 hours of bedtime.</p>

                    <h2>Managing Sleep Anxiety</h2>
                    <p>If you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, leave the bedroom and do a quiet activity until sleepy. Avoid clock-watching, which increases anxiety. Practice acceptance rather than fighting wakefulness.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Improving sleep quality requires consistent application of multiple strategies. Start with 2-3 practices and gradually add others. Be patient—habit formation takes time, but the health benefits of quality sleep are profound and far-reaching.</p>
