                    <p>Protein is essential for muscle maintenance, immune function, and numerous physiological processes. Yet confusion about optimal intake persists. This evidence-based guide clarifies how much protein you need and the best ways to consume it.</p>

                    <h2>Why Protein Matters</h2>
                    <p>Protein provides amino acids, the building blocks for muscle tissue, enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. Adequate protein supports muscle preservation during weight loss, promotes satiety, and enables recovery from exercise.</p>

                    <h2>How Much Do You Need?</h2>
                    <p>Protein requirements vary based on activity level, age, and goals. Current research suggests 1.6-2.2g per kilogram of body weight daily for active individuals seeking muscle maintenance or growth. Sedentary adults need approximately 0.8-1.0g per kilogram.</p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Practical Application</h4>
                        <p>A 70kg active person should target 110-155g protein daily, distributed across 3-4 meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Protein Distribution</h2>
                    <p>Distributing protein evenly throughout the day optimizes muscle protein synthesis. Aim for 20-40g per meal, with each serving containing adequate leucine to trigger anabolic signaling. This approach outperforms consuming the same total amount in fewer, larger doses.</p>

                    <h2>Quality Matters</h2>
                    <p>Complete proteins containing all essential amino acids support optimal health. Animal sources like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy provide complete protein profiles. Plant-based eaters should combine various sources throughout the day to ensure adequate amino acid intake.</p>

                    <h2>Timing Considerations</h2>
                    <p>Protein timing matters most around training. Consuming protein within 2-3 hours post-workout maximizes recovery. However, total daily protein intake matters more than precise timing for most individuals.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Adequate protein intake supports health, performance, and body composition. Focus on hitting daily targets through quality sources distributed across meals. Individual needs vary, so adjust based on goals, activity level, and response.</p>
