                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Building running endurance is a gradual process that requires patience, consistency, and smart training strategies. Whether you're preparing for your first 5K or looking to improve your marathon time, these evidence-based principles will help you build endurance safely.</p>

                    <h2>The 10% Rule</h2>
                    <p>The most important principle in building endurance is progressive overload applied cautiously. The 10% rule suggests increasing your weekly mileage by no more than 10% each week. This conservative approach reduces injury risk while still promoting adaptation.</p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Injury Prevention</h4>
                        <p>Research shows that runners who increase mileage too quickly have significantly higher injury rates. Patience in progression pays long-term dividends.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Base Building Phase</h2>
                    <p>Before focusing on speed or distance, establish a solid aerobic base. This phase involves running at comfortable, conversational pace for several weeks or months. Base building strengthens connective tissues, improves mitochondrial density, and develops the cardiovascular system.</p>

                    <h2>Long Run Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Incorporate one long run per week, typically comprising 20-30% of your weekly mileage. These runs should be at easy pace, building gradually. The long run develops cardiovascular endurance, teaches your body to burn fat efficiently, and builds mental toughness.</p>

                    <h2>Recovery and Rest Days</h2>
                    <p>Adaptation happens during recovery, not during the run itself. Schedule at least one complete rest day per week, and consider easy recovery runs on other days. Listen to your body and take extra rest when needed.</p>

                    <h2>Cross-Training Benefits</h2>
                    <p>Supplement running with low-impact activities like cycling, swimming, or strength training. Cross-training maintains cardiovascular fitness while reducing repetitive stress on running-specific muscles and joints.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Building running endurance requires consistency, patience, and smart progression. Focus on gradual increases, prioritize recovery, and remember that sustainable improvement takes time. The runners who stay healthy and consistent ultimately achieve the best results.</p>
