                <p>Tokyo's food scene is legendary, but the real culinary magic happens not in Michelin-starred restaurants but in tiny ramen shops, izakaya alleys, and street food stalls where locals queue for hours.</p>
                <h2>Tsukiji Outer Market</h2>
                <p>Though the famous fish auction moved to Toyosu, the outer market remains a food lover's paradise. I arrived at 6 AM to sample fresh sashimi, grilled seafood on sticks, and tamagoyaki (sweet egg omelet) that vendors have perfected over decades. The tuna rice bowl at one small shop is the best ¥1,000 I've ever spent.</p>
                <h2>Memory Lane (Omoide Yokocho)</h2>
                <p>This narrow alley near Shinjuku Station holds tiny yakitori stalls where office workers gather after work. Each stall seats maybe eight people. I squeezed into one and ordered an assortment of skewers—chicken, liver, vegetables—each grilled to perfection over charcoal. The beer flowed, the conversation was lively, and I felt like I'd stumbled into the real Tokyo.</p>
                <h2>Late Night Ramen</h2>
                <p>At 1 AM, I found myself at a ramen shop under the train tracks in Yurakucho. The master works alone, making each bowl with focused intensity. The tonkotsu broth had been simmering for 12 hours. This is Tokyo's night shift cuisine—nourishing, delicious, and served with no pretense.</p>

                    <h3>Food Tip</h3>
                    <p>Don't be afraid of restaurants with queues—they're usually worth the wait. Learn basic Japanese food words. Cash is still king at many small establishments. Slurp your noodles—it's good manners and cools them down.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Tokyo's street food and small eateries offer an intimate glimpse into Japanese culture. These are places where quality matters more than presentation, where regulars are family, and where the simple act of eating becomes communion.</p>
