            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Berlin is a city that demands to be explored on two wheels. With over 1,000 kilometers of dedicated bike paths, flat terrain, and a cycling culture that's second to none, the German capital reveals its true character when you trade your walking shoes for a bicycle.</p>

                <p>I spent a week cycling through Berlin's diverse neighborhoods, each with its own personality and stories. From the street art of Kreuzberg to the gentrified charm of Prenzlauer Berg, my bike became not just a means of transport, but a key to unlocking the city's secrets.</p>

                <h2>Day 1: East Side Gallery to Friedrichshain</h2>
                <p>My journey began at the East Side Gallery, a 1.3-kilometer stretch of the Berlin Wall that's been transformed into the world's longest open-air gallery. Cycling slowly past the colorful murals, I was struck by how this symbol of division has become a canvas for hope and artistic expression.</p>

                <p>From there, I pedaled into Friedrichshain, a neighborhood that perfectly encapsulates Berlin's evolution. Soviet-era apartment blocks stand alongside trendy cafés, and the energy is electric. I stopped at RAW-Gelände, a former railway yard turned cultural space, where street food vendors, beer gardens, and techno clubs coexist in harmonious chaos.</p>

                <h2>Day 2: Tiergarten and the Government District</h2>
                <p>The Tiergarten is Berlin's green lung—a massive park that's perfect for cycling. I spent the morning exploring its winding paths, stumbling upon hidden memorials, beer gardens tucked between trees, and locals sunbathing by the lake.</p>

                <p>Cycling past the Reichstag, Germany's parliament building, I was reminded of Berlin's role at the heart of modern European history. The glass dome, designed by Norman Foster, symbolizes the transparency of democracy—a powerful statement in a city that knows the alternative all too well.</p>

                <div class="travel-tip">
                    <h3>Practical Tip</h3>
                    <p>Rent a bike from one of Berlin's many bike shops or use the city's bike-sharing system. A day rental costs around €15-20. Make sure to get a lock—bike theft is common in Berlin!</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Day 3: Kreuzberg's Street Art Scene</h2>
                <p>Kreuzberg is where Berlin's rebel heart beats loudest. I spent the day cycling through streets adorned with some of the world's best street art. Around every corner, murals tell stories of resistance, love, and political commentary.</p>

                <p>I stopped at Görlitzer Park, known locally as "Görli," a green space that's equal parts community hub and bohemian hangout. The canal that runs through Kreuzberg is perfect for a sunset ride, with locals gathered on the banks sharing drinks and music.</p>

                <h2>Day 4: Prenzlauer Berg and the Mauerpark</h2>
                <p>Prenzlauer Berg couldn't be more different from Kreuzberg. This former East Berlin neighborhood has been transformed into one of the city's most desirable areas, with renovated apartment buildings, organic cafés, and designer boutiques.</p>

                <p>On Sunday, I cycled to Mauerpark for the famous flea market. Thousands of Berliners and tourists gather here to browse vintage treasures, watch street performers, and participate in the legendary bearpit karaoke—where anyone can grab the mic and perform for a crowd of hundreds.</p>

                <h2>Day 5: Museum Island and Unter den Linden</h2>
                <p>A visit to Berlin wouldn't be complete without exploring its cultural institutions. I cycled to Museum Island, a UNESCO World Heritage site housing five world-class museums. Even if you don't go inside, the island's architecture and position in the River Spree make it worth the visit.</p>

                <p>From there, I rode down Unter den Linden, Berlin's historic boulevard. Passing the Brandenburg Gate, I reflected on how this symbol has witnessed so much of modern history—from Prussian glory to Nazi rallies, from the Cold War division to German reunification.</p>

                <div class="travel-tip">
                    <h3>Safety Note</h3>
                    <p>Berlin drivers are generally cyclist-friendly, but stay alert. Use the dedicated bike lanes (marked in red), signal your turns, and be cautious at intersections. Don't cycle on sidewalks—it's illegal and dangerous for pedestrians.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Hidden Gems on Two Wheels</h2>
                <p>Some of my best discoveries came from simply getting lost. I found a Vietnamese market in Lichtenberg where locals gather on weekends. I stumbled upon Tempelhofer Feld, a former airport that's now a massive public park where Berliners cycle, skate, and fly kites on the old runways.</p>

                <p>In Neukölln, I discovered a rapidly changing neighborhood where Turkish shops mix with hipster bars, creating a fascinating cultural blend. A tiny café on Weserstraße served the best flat white I had all week, and the barista shared recommendations for cycling routes I'd never find in a guidebook.</p>

                <h2>The Berlin Cycling Experience</h2>
                <p>What makes cycling in Berlin special isn't just the infrastructure or the flat terrain. It's the freedom to explore at your own pace, to stop whenever something catches your eye, and to cover far more ground than you could on foot.</p>

                <p>Berlin is a sprawling city, and its best neighborhoods are spread out. A bike compresses the distances, turning a potentially overwhelming metropolis into a series of connected villages, each waiting to be discovered.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>After a week on two wheels, I'd barely scratched the surface of Berlin. This is a city that rewards curiosity and exploration, where history and modernity collide on every corner. My bike gave me independence and flexibility, allowing me to create my own journey rather than following prescribed routes.</p>

                <p>Whether you're a seasoned cyclist or someone who hasn't ridden in years, Berlin makes it easy. Rent a bike, grab a map (or just follow your instincts), and let the city reveal itself one pedal stroke at a time.</p>
