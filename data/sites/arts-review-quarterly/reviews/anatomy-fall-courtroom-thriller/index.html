      Justine Triet's <em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> is that rare courtroom drama that transcends its genre to become something more profound—a dissection of marriage, truth, and the impossibility of ever fully knowing another person. Winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, this French thriller is intellectually stimulating and emotionally wrenching in equal measure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sandra Hüller delivers one of the year's best performances as Sandra Voyter, a successful novelist accused of murdering her husband Samuel, whose body is found at the base of their secluded chalet. Did he fall? Jump? Was he pushed? Hüller makes Sandra prickly, intelligent, and impossible to read—exactly the kind of woman a sexist justice system loves to condemn.

      "Triet understands that truth in human relationships is never simple, and justice is even more elusive."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The trial becomes an excavation of Sandra and Samuel's marriage, and Triet refuses to give us easy answers. We hear recordings of their arguments—bitter, petty, hurtful in the way long marriages can be. Sandra is not a perfect victim; she's complicated, flawed, ambitious. The film asks: does that make her a murderer? And more disturbingly, does our answer depend on her likability?
    </p>

    <p>
      Young Milo Machado-Graner is extraordinary as Daniel, the couple's visually impaired son who becomes a key witness. His testimony is the film's emotional climax, a child forced to choose between truth and loyalty, between his parents. The film's French title references Anatomy of a Murder, but it's really about the anatomy of a family under microscopic examination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cinematographer Simon Beaufils keeps the camera observant but never intrusive. The courtroom scenes have the procedural precision of documentary; the flashbacks carry the intimacy of memory. The editing by Laurent Sénéchal maintains tension while allowing scenes to breathe. Even at 150 minutes, the film never drags.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
      "This is filmmaking as investigation—into relationships, into justice, into the stories we tell about ourselves."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      What makes <em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> exceptional is its refusal of closure. We may get a verdict, but Triet understands that legal conclusions and actual truth are different things. The film leaves us with ambiguity—not because it's coy, but because it's honest about how little we can ever truly know about the interior lives of others, even those we love.
    </p>

    <p>
      The film also works as a commentary on how the French legal system (and by extension, society) judges women. Sandra's independence, her affairs, her ambition—all become evidence against her character. Triet shows how quickly a woman's refusal to perform feminine niceness becomes proof of depravity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The use of music is inspired—from 50 Cent's "P.I.M.P." as a plot point to the instrumental version that scores key scenes. It's unexpected and perfect, adding irony and emotional texture. Every creative choice feels considered and purposeful.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> is adult filmmaking at its finest—complex, ambiguous, trusting its audience to grapple with difficult questions. Hüller and Triet have created an unforgettable character and surrounded her with a narrative that constantly shifts our sympathies and assumptions. This is a thriller that thrills intellectually as much as emotionally, a mystery that understands the greatest mysteries are human beings themselves. Essential viewing.
