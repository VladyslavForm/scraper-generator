      Yorgos Lanthimos has never been a filmmaker interested in convention, but with <em>Poor Things</em>, he's created his most accessible work without sacrificing an ounce of his singular vision. This wildly inventive steampunk Frankenstein tale is both a visual feast and a sharp feminist fable about liberation, agency, and what it means to become oneself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emma Stone delivers the performance of her career as Bella Baxter, a woman brought back to life with the brain of her unborn child. Watching Bella evolve from infantile curiosity to full personhood is mesmerizing. Stone fearlessly commits to every stage of Bella's development—the physical comedy of early scenes, the sexual awakening, the intellectual flowering, and finally the righteous anger of someone discovering the world's injustices.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
      "Lanthimos has crafted a film that's simultaneously his most outrageous and most humane—a candy-colored fairy tale with genuine philosophical weight."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The supporting cast is equally game. Mark Ruffalo is hilarious as Duncan Wedderburn, a rakish lawyer whose smug confidence crumbles as Bella outgrows him. Willem Dafoe brings unexpected warmth to Godwin Baxter, Bella's creator, playing him not as a mad scientist but as a protective, flawed father figure. Ramy Youssef's quiet, decent Max provides a moral anchor amidst the film's more extreme elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visually, <em>Poor Things</em> is stunning. Cinematographers Robbie Ryan and the production design team create a world that feels both Victorian and otherworldly. Lisbon appears as a pastel fantasy, Paris as a grimy labyrinth, Alexandria as a sun-bleached dreamscape. The fish-eye lenses and aspect ratio changes aren't gimmicks but visual representations of Bella's expanding consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes the film work beyond its considerable aesthetic pleasures is its thematic coherence. This is fundamentally a story about a woman claiming her body, her sexuality, and her autonomy in a world that wants to control all three. Bella's journey from object to subject mirrors countless real women's struggles, but Lanthimos tells it through fantastical metaphor that makes it feel fresh and urgent.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
      "Stone gives us a character who discovers pleasure, knowledge, and power—and refuses to apologize for any of it."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The film's frankness about sexuality will undoubtedly challenge some viewers, but it's essential to Bella's story. Her sexual exploration isn't gratuitous; it's a woman learning that her body belongs to her, that pleasure is her right, and that society's shame around female sexuality is absurd. The brothel sequence, which could have been exploitative, instead becomes a space where Bella finds community and purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there's a weakness, it's that the film's episodic structure sometimes feels uneven. The pacing in the middle section drags slightly, and some supporting characters feel underdeveloped. But these are minor quibbles about a film that swings for the fences and mostly succeeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jerskin Fendrix's score deserves mention—strange, beautiful, unsettling music that perfectly complements the film's tonal balancing act between comedy, tragedy, and something harder to define. The costumes by Holly Waddington are works of art, each outfit telling us exactly where Bella is in her evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Poor Things</em> is Lanthimos at his most confident and playful. He's made a film that's deeply weird yet emotionally resonant, that champions female autonomy while also being consistently funny and entertaining. It's a testament to cinema's ability to tackle serious ideas through fantastical means. Emma Stone's fearless performance anchors it all, giving us one of the year's most memorable characters. This is bold, uncompromising filmmaking that proves art-house sensibilities and sheer entertainment need not be mutually exclusive.
