      Christopher Nolan's <em>Oppenheimer</em> is a triumph of biographical filmmaking—a three-hour meditation on genius, hubris, and moral consequence that never feels its length. Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's biography "American Prometheus," the film tackles J. Robert Oppenheimer's life with the intellectual rigor and formal precision we've come to expect from Nolan, but with a newfound emotional depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cillian Murphy finally gets the lead role he deserves, and he's mesmerizing. His Oppenheimer is brilliant, arrogant, haunted—a man who changed the world and spent the rest of his life grappling with what that meant. Murphy's gaunt face becomes a canvas for moral anguish, especially in the post-Hiroshima sequences where Oppenheimer confronts what his creation has wrought.

    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
      "Nolan has made his most mature film—a searing examination of scientific ambition and its terrible consequences."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The supporting ensemble is remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. delivers career-best work as Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer's political nemesis, playing him with wounded pride and calculated vengeance. Emily Blunt's Kitty Oppenheimer cuts through every scene with sharp intelligence. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, and countless others make indelible impressions despite limited screen time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nolan's trademark non-linear structure serves the story well. The film intercuts between three timelines—Oppenheimer's rise, the Trinity test, and his 1954 security clearance hearing. This approach creates mounting tension and allows Nolan to explore how actions reverberate across decades. The Trinity test sequence itself is a stunning piece of cinema—minimal dialogue, overwhelming sound design, pure visual storytelling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hoyte van Hoytema's 65mm IMAX cinematography is breathtaking. Every frame feels considered, from intimate close-ups to vast New Mexico landscapes. Ludwig Göransson's score pulses with anxiety and grandeur, propelling the narrative forward while allowing space for quiet character moments.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
      "This is blockbuster filmmaking for adults—complex, challenging, and deeply rewarding."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      What elevates <em>Oppenheimer</em> beyond technical excellence is its moral seriousness. Nolan doesn't provide easy answers about whether building the bomb was right or wrong. Instead, he shows us a man caught between scientific curiosity, patriotic duty, and human conscience. The film asks: what responsibility do scientists bear for how their discoveries are used? Can intellectual achievement justify mass destruction?
    </p>

    <p>
      The final act, focused on Oppenheimer's persecution during the McCarthyism era, is deeply moving. Watching this titan reduced to answering petty accusations from small-minded bureaucrats is infuriating. Yet Nolan also shows how Oppenheimer's earlier arrogance and political naiveté contributed to his downfall.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Oppenheimer</em> is Nolan's best film since <em>The Prestige</em>—perhaps his best overall. It's proof that big-budget filmmaking can be intelligent, sophisticated, and commercially viable. This is essential cinema: a film about history that speaks urgently to our present moment, when scientific advancement continues to outpace our moral frameworks. Murphy and Nolan have created a haunting portrait of a man who gave us the power to end the world.
