      At 80, Martin Scorsese continues to evolve, and <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> finds him in elegiac mode—still masterful, but now more contemplative about American violence and greed. This sprawling adaptation of David Grann's non-fiction book examines the murders of Osage Nation members in 1920s Oklahoma with moral clarity and devastating impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leonardo DiCaprio anchors the film as Ernest Burkhart, a weak-willed man manipulated by his uncle (Robert De Niro's chilling William Hale) into marrying Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone) to access her oil wealth. DiCaprio resists making Ernest sympathetic—this is a portrait of banal evil, of a man choosing money and white supremacy over the woman he claims to love.

      "Scorsese has made his most explicitly political film—an American tragedy that indicts systems of exploitation that persist today."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Lily Gladstone is revelatory as Mollie. In a film structured around white male criminality, she quietly commands every scene she's in. Her performance is interior, dignified, heartbreaking—watching her realize the depth of her husband's betrayal is gutting. Gladstone makes Mollie fully human in a way that Hollywood rarely allows Indigenous characters to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stunning. The Oklahoma landscapes are beautiful and foreboding, wealth and death coexisting in every frame. Robbie Robertson's final score (he passed during post-production) honors Osage musical traditions while creating tension and mourning. The technical craft is impeccable, as expected from Scorsese and his longtime collaborators.
    </p>

    <p>
      At 206 minutes, the film demands patience. Scorsese's pacing is deliberate, almost novelistic, accumulating detail and dread. Some viewers will find it too long; others will recognize that the length serves the material—these were systematic murders spanning years, and the film's duration makes us feel the weight of that sustained violence.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
      "This is not entertainment—it's witness, testimony, and reckoning with America's genocidal foundations."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      What sets this apart from Scorsese's other crime films is its refusal of glamour. There's no thrill in the violence here, no charismatic antiheroes. Just greed, racism, and murder. The film makes clear that American capitalism was built on the theft and exploitation of Indigenous land and lives—and that this history isn't past but prologue.
    </p>

    <p>
      The coda, featuring Scorsese himself in a radio drama about the murders, is a brilliant meta-textual move. It acknowledges the limits of cinematic representation, the way these real tragedies become entertainment, and the filmmaker's own complicity in that transformation. It's humble and profound.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> is essential American cinema—difficult, necessary, and deeply felt. Scorsese has made a film about the past that speaks urgently to the present, about how white supremacy and capitalism combine into deadly force. That he's done so with such formal mastery and moral seriousness confirms his status as one of our greatest living filmmakers. This is not an easy watch, but it's a vital one.
